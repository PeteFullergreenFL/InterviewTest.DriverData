First, read the readme.md!

Then complete the subtasks in order, making a commit after each one.

Assume the tasks are added by your product owner over the course of several weeks, so you won't know about 1.2 until some time after you've finished 1.1 - if your first commit shows signs of preparing for later requirements, we'll assume you're violating YAGNI!
